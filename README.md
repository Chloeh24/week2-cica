# week2-cica - USER STORIES

### As a user interested in crime in my area, I want to:
      - view the app on all of my devices 
      - be able to input dates and postcode to view crime rates
      - see a breakdown of crimes in my chosen area 
      
### As a police officer user, I want to:
      - see the most common types of crime in a given area
      - see how many crimes occurred per month
      - compare the breakdown of these crimes by month

## Are you REALLY safe? ðŸš“
